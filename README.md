## What is Patchouli?

Patchouli aims to be your personal search engine for all the things you know and love.

Patchouli is built for people who are born in the post-Google era.
We search for things, not organize them in complicated hierarchical structures.

## Hack Patchouli

```shell-session
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## FAQ

This section is from the perspective of the original author, Yuki.

### Why is the project called Patchouli X?

In the beginning, Patchouli was intended to be a subscription-based SaaS product.
However, after months of development, I felt conflicted about the direction of the project.
Mainly surrounding user privacy, data ownership, and the unfun part that is running a SaaS business.

So, I decided to start over and build an offline-first and open-source version of Patchouli, which is Patchouli X.
